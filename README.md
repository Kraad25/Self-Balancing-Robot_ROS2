# Self-Balancing-Robot_ROS2
 This project simulates a Self-Balancing Robot that can balance itself using either a classical control system (LQR) or a learned policy (PPO).

## Key Features
 * ROS2 Humble and Gazebo Classic-based simulation.
 * IMU sensor for real-time tilt estimation
 * Two Balancing strategies:
   - Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) for classical control
   - Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for reinforcement learning
